Flutter Authentication App
This project is a simple Flutter application designed to demonstrate basic authentication functionality, including sign-in and sign-up screens with form validation. The app consists of the following key features:

Sign In Screen:

Users can enter their email and password to sign in.
The form includes validation to ensure proper email format and a minimum password length of 6 characters.
Upon successful form submission, a SnackBar indicates the sign-in process.

Sign Up Screen:

Users can register by providing an email, password, and confirming their password.
The form includes validation for proper email format, a minimum password length of 6 characters, and matching passwords.
Upon successful form submission, a SnackBar indicates the sign-up process.

User Interface:

Both screens have a clean and user-friendly interface with input fields for email and password.
Buttons are provided for form submission and navigating between sign-in and sign-up screens.
The background color of the screens is set to brown for a distinct appearance.
The project aims to provide a basic structure for implementing authentication in a Flutter app, demonstrating form handling, validation, and user feedback through SnackBars.
